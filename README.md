# LangChain4j EasyWorkflow

LangChain4j EasyWorkflow is a library that offers a fluent, DSL-style API for building complex agentic workflows on top of the LangChain4j Agentic framework. It removes boilerplate and makes it simple to express AI workflows in a clear, readable way.

With EasyWorkflow, you can define workflows that include sequences of agents, conditional branches, parallel execution, agent groups, and loops, combining flexibility with elegance.

## Features

*   **Fluent API:** A simple and intuitive DSL-style API for defining complex agent workflows.
*   **Sequential Execution:** Define a sequence of agents that will be executed one after another.
*   **Conditional Execution:** Execute agents based on a condition.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Execute agents in parallel and compose their outputs.
*   **Agent Grouping:** Group agents and supervise their execution.
*   **Loops:** Repeat a sequence of agents until a condition is met.

## How to use EasyWorkflow

The `EasyWorkflow` is the main entry point for creating workflows. Hereâ€™s how to use it for common tasks. To start you can use `EasyWorkflow.builder(Class<?> agentClass)` method to get a builder object and provide the main agentic interface.

### 1. Basic Configuration

Before adding agents, you need to configure the workflow. At a minimum, you must provide a `ChatModel`. You can also provide a `ChatMemory` instance to maintain conversation history and specify an `outputName` for the final result.

```java
// Import your chat model, e.g., OpenAiChatModel
// Import a chat memory, e.g., MessageWindowChatMemory

ExpertRouterAgent expertRouterAgent = EasyWorkflow.builder(ExpertRouterAgent.class)
        .chatModel(chatModel) // Mandatory: The chat model for the agents
        .chatMemory(chatMemory) // Optional: Shared memory for the agents
        .outputName("finalAnswer") // Optional: Name for the workflow's output
        // ... add agents and control flow here
        .build();
```

### 2. Adding Agents

You can add agents to the workflow to be executed sequentially. You can add an agent by its class or by providing an already-created instance.

```java
NovelCreator novelCreator = EasyWorkflow.builder(NovelCreator.class)
        .chatModel(BASE_MODEL)
        // Add agents by their class
        .agent(CreativeWriter.class)
        .agent(AudienceEditor.class)
        // You can also add a pre-configured agent instance
        // .agent(new MyCustomAgent())
        .build();
```

### 3. Adding Control Flow

For more complex workflows, you can use control flow statements like `ifThen`, `repeat`, `doParallel`, and `group`. Each of these statements opens a block that must be closed with the `end()` method.

Here's an example combining a conditional and a loop:

```java
ExpertRouterAgent expertRouterAgent = EasyWorkflow.builder(ExpertRouterAgent.class)
        .chatModel(BASE_MODEL)
        .agent(CategoryRouter.class)
        // Execute a block of agents only if a condition is met
        .ifThen(scope -> scope.readState("category", "UNKNOWN").equals("LEGAL"))
            .agent(LegalExpert.class)
            // You can nest control flow
            .repeat(2, scope -> scope.readState("isClear", false) == true)
                .agent(LegalClarifier.class)
            .end() // Closes the 'repeat' block
        .end() // Closes the 'ifThen' block
        .build();
```

## Sample for Sequential and Repeatable Agents

The following example shows how to create a sequential workflow with a repeatable block of agents. You may check the [Sequential Workflow](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/tutorials/agents#sequential-workflow)
and [Loop Workflow](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/tutorials/agents#loop-workflow) for complete samples description or check the runnable test at [TestSequentialAndRepeatableAgents.java](/src/test/java/com/gl/langchain4j/easyworkflow/TestSequentialAndRepeatableAgents.java)

```java
NovelCreator novelCreator = EasyWorkflow.builder(NovelCreator.class)
        .chatModel(BASE_MODEL)
        .agent(CreativeWriter.class)
        .agent(AudienceEditor.class)
        .repeat(5, agenticScope -> agenticScope.readState("score", 0.0) >= 0.8)
            .agent(StyleScorer.class)
            .agent(StyleEditor.class)
        .end()
        .build();

        .chatMemory(chatMemory)
        .agent(CategoryRouter.class)
        .ifThen(agenticScope -> agenticScope.readState("category", RequestCategory.UNKNOWN) == RequestCategory.MEDICAL)
            .agent(MedicalExpert.class).end()
        .ifThen(agenticScope -> agenticScope.readState("category", RequestCategory.UNKNOWN) == RequestCategory.LEGAL)
            .agent(LegalExpert.class).end()
        .ifThen(agenticScope -> agenticScope.readState("category", RequestCategory.UNKNOWN) == RequestCategory.TECHNICAL)
            .agent(TechnicalExpert.class).end()
        .build();

expertRouterAgent.ask("Should I sue my neighbor who caused this damage?");
```

## Sample for Parallel Agents

You may check the [Parallel Workflow](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/tutorials/agents#parallel-workflow) for complete samples description or check the runnable test at [TestParallelAgents.java](/src/test/java/com/gl/langchain4j/easyworkflow/TestParallelAgents.java)


```java
Function<AgenticScope, Object> resultFunction = agenticScope -> {
    List<String> movies = agenticScope.readState("movies", List.of());
    List<String> meals = agenticScope.readState("meals", List.of());

    List<EveningPlan> moviesAndMeals = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < movies.size(); i++) {
        if (i >= meals.size()) {
            break;
        }
        moviesAndMeals.add(new EveningPlan(movies.get(i), meals.get(i)));
    }
    return moviesAndMeals;
};

EveningPlannerAgent eveningPlannerAgent = EasyWorkflow.builder(EveningPlannerAgent.class)
        .chatModel(BASE_MODEL)
        .doParallel(resultFunction)
            .agent(FoodExpert.class)
            .agent(MovieExpert.class)
        .end()
        .build();

eveningPlannerAgent.plan("happy");
```
